            "I started to realise change from our societies when our school allowed females to study subjects such as basic handicrafts and design and techology which long ago woud've been considered 'male only' subjects.Our teachers recently realised that females are just as capable of handling the tasks that come with studying these subjects as well as their male counterparts. It was also realised that most female students have a great eye for design and usually bring better, more practical ideas for projects. BasaliTech's mission is similaras its main aim is to equip young girls and women with the necessary skills to be competent in the fast paced future that is the fourth industrial revolution. For most students in Lesotho, where the majority of the population is heavily reliant on a government approve curriculum and government ran institutions, computer learning is just not the norm, hence with its  mission, BasaliTech has taken one step forward in bridging this gap,"said Palesa Kamohi.

            <p>"Growing up a pageant princess, i always had dreams of winning a major international pageant. In 2017 when i met the then Miss South Africa, who later became Miss Universe of the same year, i felt a step closer towards my dream.Having a onversation with one of my idols ignited further, my ambition.However, looking at her, i realised something very important, she looked nothing like me. Infact most of the previous winners of the pageant looked nothing like me. They all had sandy blonde hair, striking light eyes, eurocentric features that were celebrated everywhere in the world.It hurt, i felt invisible. In 2019, it all changed when a young lady from a small town in a continent that is hardly ever recognised, won. Zozibini Tunzi won Miss Universe, crushing all beauty stereotypes as we know them.Short, kinky hair and dark hair, a Miss Universe that looks like me. For the first time in my life, i had an opportunity to see the world marvel and appreciate Afrocentric features. A major win for black girls worldwide,"said Lebo Ramohapi.</p>
